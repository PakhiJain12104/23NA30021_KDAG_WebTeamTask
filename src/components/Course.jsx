            <h3>DNA STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</h3>
            <p>
              <h4>
                DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the
                genetic instructions essential for the development, functioning,
                growth, and reproduction of all known living organisms.
                Structurally, DNA is composed of two strands forming a double
                helix, with each strand made up of nucleotides containing a
                sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases
                (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine). The specific pairing
                of these bases (A-T and C-G) enables the accurate replication of
                DNA during cell division. DNA's role is crucial in storing
                genetic information, guiding the synthesis of proteins, and
                ensuring hereditary continuity from one generation to the next.

                {" "}
                Genetic variation refers to the diversity in gene frequencies
                within a population, arising from differences in the DNA
                sequence. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can
                introduce new genetic variations. These changes can occur due to
                errors during DNA replication, exposure to mutagens, or through
                recombination processes. While many mutations are neutral or
                harmful, some can confer beneficial traits that enhance an
                organism's survival and reproduction. This genetic diversity is
                fundamental to the process of evolution and natural selection,
                driving the adaptation of species to their environments.

            <h3>MODERN GENETIC TECHNIQUES</h3>
            <p>
              <h4>
                Modern genetic techniques encompass advanced methods used to
                study and manipulate genetic material. Techniques such as
                Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) allow for the amplification of
                specific DNA sequences, while CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise
                editing of genes. DNA sequencing technologies, like
                next-generation sequencing (NGS), provide detailed insights into
                genetic information by rapidly determining the order of
                nucleotides. These techniques have revolutionized fields such as
                medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology by facilitating genetic
                research, improving disease diagnosis and treatment, and
                enhancing crop and livestock breeding.

            <h3>ETHICAL ISSUES IN GENETICS</h3>
            <p>
              <h4>
                Ethical issues in genetics involve the moral implications and
                societal impacts of genetic research and technology. Key
                concerns include privacy and confidentiality of genetic
                information, potential discrimination based on genetic traits,
                and the ethical considerations of genetic modifications in
                humans, such as gene editing and cloning. Additionally, the use
                of genetic data in reproductive decisions and the potential for
                "designer babies" raise significant ethical debates. Ensuring
                informed consent, equitable access to genetic advancements, and
                responsible use of genetic technologies are crucial in
                addressing these ethical challenges.

            <p>
              <h4>
                The review and final exam in a genetics course provide a
                comprehensive overview of the material covered, including DNA
                structure and function, genetic variation and mutation, modern
                genetic techniques, and ethical issues in genetics. The review
                sessions reinforce key concepts and address any areas of
                difficulty, ensuring students have a solid understanding. The
                final exam typically includes a mix of multiple-choice, short
                answer, and essay questions to assess students' knowledge and
                critical thinking skills. This assessment measures students'
                grasp of genetic principles and their ability to apply this
                knowledge to real-world scenarios.
